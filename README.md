# smartbrainapidockerized

I have put the Postgresql and the Redis database inside of a Docker container along with the Express server (Backend) in this repository. This makes it easy to run the app on any system for code analysis.
I have also deployed this docker container on AWS EC2 server and connected it to the frontend of the Smartbrain app.
